# Global-AI-Job-Market-Analysis
## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the global AI job market from October 2024 to April 2025 using SQL and visualization tools. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer key questions across four main areas: Hiring Market Overview, Salary Differences, Talent Profile, and Hiring Dynamics. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, analysis framework, business questions and solution code, dashboard visualizations, and conclusions.
## Objectives
- Identify where AI jobs are primarily located, what types of employment and work arrangements exist, and the approximate salary levels.
- Examine which structural factors mainly determine salary differences across positions.
- Explore the types of talent required for different job categories.
- Analyze which AI job sectors have the highest demand and how these trends evolve over time.
## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset: Global AI Job Market Trends & Salary Insights 2025  

**Brief Description:** The AI & Data Job Salaries and Skills Dataset 2024-2025 is synthetically prepared and provides a detailed, global overview of job listings in artificial intelligence, data science, machine learning, and related fields. This dataset aggregates job postings from October 2024 to July 2025, capturing a wide spectrum of roles, required skills, compensation, and organizational attributes across multiple countries and industries.
